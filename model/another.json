This situation can\n\noccur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be\n\nbroken, as stated below :\n\n\n\n  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the\n\n    server might not be descended from a known public\n\n    certificate authority. This can occur either when the\n\n    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed\n\n    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are\n\n    missing that would connect the top of the certificate\n\n    chain to a known public certificate authority.\n\n\n\n  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate\n\n    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can\n\n    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the\n\n    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the\n\n    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.\n\n\n\n  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature\n\n    that either didn't match the certificate's information\n\n    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by\n\n    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be\n\n    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be\n\n    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer\n\n    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not\n\n    support or does not recognize.\n\n\n\nIf the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the\n\nchain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and \n\nidentity of the web server.
